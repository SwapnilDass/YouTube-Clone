# YouTube-Clone
This project is a front-end clone of the YouTube homepage, built using HTML and CSS. I used my web development skills to closely replicate the layout, structure, and design of the original site. The goal of this project was to practice and showcase my ability to recreate complex web interfaces using only HTML and CSS. It includes a responsive layout, navigation bar, sidebar, video grid, and other key elements found on YouTube.

Feel free to explore the code and see how I structured the components to match the real platform!
